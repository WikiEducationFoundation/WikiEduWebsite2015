      <p>When students edit Wikipedia, they show the world what they know, and they show themselves that they know. They&rsquo;re making a statement. Not just in their contribution, but by contributing. They’re looking at what they’ve learned and they tell the world: “I know this.” That&rsquo;s the difference between writing for assignments and writing for an audience.</p>

      <p>Students make the leap from passive learning to an active expression of knowledge. They rephrase and revise their understanding as they work. They put it into their own words, they make it theirs, and pass it on. In the end, they&rsquo;ve shared real knowledge with the world. But they’ve also made that knowledge distinctly their own.</p>
